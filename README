=== BigView ===

This is source for a suite of programs to view very large images.

1) Images must first be in PPM format
2) generate a .PAGED format image running genPaged on a .PPM
3) view a .PAGED file with showPaged

Building
---------
$> perl ./makeLinks.pl
$> make -j

makeLinks.pl ensures all libs/apps are built with the same flags.
Put locally-required build changes in the top-level Global.defs.
